      "summary": "A legendary creature from Latin American folklore, first reported in Puerto Rico in 1995. Known for allegedly attacking livestock and draining their blood through small puncture wounds.",
      "full": "The Chupacabra (Spanish for 'goat-sucker') is a cryptid that emerged in Puerto Rico in 1995 and quickly spread through Latin America and the southern United States. The creature is blamed for attacks on livestock, particularly goats, sheep, and chickens, which are found dead with puncture wounds and allegedly drained of blood. Two distinct forms are reported: the original Puerto Rican version described as a bipedal reptilian creature with spines, and the Texan/Mexican version resembling a hairless canine. The phenomenon has been attributed to various causes including wild dogs with mange, coyotes, and mass hysteria following the original 1995 reports."
