## Overview

The Chupacabra (Spanish for "goat-sucker") is a cryptid that emerged in Puerto Rico in 1995 and quickly spread through Latin America and the southern United States. The creature is blamed for attacks on livestock, particularly goats, sheep, and chickens, which are found dead with puncture wounds and allegedly drained of blood. Two distinct forms are reported: the original Puerto Rican version described as a bipedal reptilian creature with spines, and the Texan/Mexican version resembling a hairless canine. The phenomenon has been attributed to various causes including wild dogs with mange, coyotes, and mass hysteria following the original 1995 reports.

## Notable Sightings

### Madelyne Tolentino Sighting (1995)

- **Date**: August 1995
- **Location**: Canovanas, Puerto Rico
- **Witnesses**: 1
- **Credibility**: Medium

Madelyne Tolentino reported seeing a creature outside her mother's home in Canovanas. She described a bipedal creature approximately 3-4 feet tall with gray skin, large oval black eyes, thin arms with clawed hands, and a row of spines running down its back. This description became the iconic image of the Chupacabra.

**Note**: Some researchers note similarity to the creature from the film *Species* (1995) which Tolentino had recently seen.

### Cuero, Texas Carcass (2007)

- **Date**: August 2007
- **Location**: Cuero, Texas, USA
- **Evidence**: Physical specimen, DNA analysis

Phylis Canion discovered a hairless, blue-gray carcass on her ranch. The creature had prominent fangs, large ears, and wrinkled skin. DNA testing showed the animal was a coyote-dog hybrid, though Canion maintained it was unusual.

### Calama, Chile Attacks (2000)

- **Date**: April 2000
- **Location**: Calama, Chile
